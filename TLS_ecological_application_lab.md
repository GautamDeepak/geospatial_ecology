# Introduction to Remote Sensing of the Environment

## Ecological application of TLS

### Background and objective
The objective is to use the skills obtained in Lab 9 in a real life example. In prac 8 you were looking at a likely familiar loation - Boab court at CDU Casuarina campus. In this prac you have three scans of the field site in Litchfield NP you have seen in the Introduction to LiDAR lecture. In this prac we will align and ***co-register????*** the individual point clouds to produce a single point cloud.

## Aligning individual scans
1. Import Scan 17 and inspect the cloud. Notice how RGB works better for low points as tree foliage sways and moved between acquisitions.

2. Explore Display settings by: 
  * Toggle the ELD filter *(Display -> Shaders & Filters -> EDL filter)*
  * Adjusting point size (hover mouse in top left corner of the screen to show menu)

Working with LiDAR data, different settings will be useful for different purposes. During this prac you can adjust display settings based on personal preferences.

Next to the scan point in the centre you will see a termite mound built up on a tree trunk. After this scan was taken large areas of Litchfield NP were subject to bushfires during the last dry season.

Here is a photo taken during a repeat scan from the same postition. At this stage only a small piece of charcoaled timber remains of this large tree. After another fire there will likely be no evidence of a tree having been here in the first place.
